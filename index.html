Spring Session provides an API and implementations for managing a user's session information.

## 特性

Spring Session makes it trivial to support clustered sessions without being tied to an application container specific solution. It also provides transparent integration with:

* **HttpSession** - allows replacing the `HttpSession` in an application container (i.e. Tomcat) neutral way, with support for providing session IDs in headers to work with RESTful APIs
* **WebSocket** - provides the ability to keep the `HttpSession` alive when receiving WebSocket messages
* **WebSession** - allows replacing the Spring WebFlux's `WebSession` in an application container neutral way

## 模块

Spring Session consists of the following modules:

* **Spring Session Core** - provides core Spring Session functionalities and APIs
* **Spring Session Data Redis** - provides `SessionRepository` and `ReactiveSessionRepository` implementation backed by Redis and configuration support
* **Spring Session JDBC** - provides `SessionRepository` implementation backed by a relational database and configuration support
* **Spring Session Hazelcast** - provides `SessionRepository` implementation backed by Hazelcast and configuration support
